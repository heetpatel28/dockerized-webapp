## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** to your own GitHub account.
2. **Clone your fork** locally:

   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/dockerized-webapp.git
   cd dockerized-webapp
   ```
3. **Install dependencies** as described in the `README.md`.

4. **Set up Docker**:
   - Ensure you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed and running.
   - Build and run the application using Docker Compose:
     ```bash
     docker-compose up --build
     ```

## How to Contribute

There are several ways you can contribute:

- Reporting a bug
- Suggesting features or enhancements
- Improving documentation
- Submitting code improvements (bug fixes, new features, tests, etc.)

## Development Workflow

1. **Create a new branch** for your changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
2. **Make your changes** (add tests where appropriate).
3. **Run tests locally** to ensure all features work and nothing is broken.
4. **Rebuild the Docker containers** if your changes affect the Docker configuration:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
5. **Commit your changes** with clear and descriptive commit messages.

## Code Style

- Follow the language and framework conventions used in the project.
- Maintain consistency with existing code.
- Format code using the appropriate linter/formatter.
- Write clear, concise, and well-documented code.

## Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Use a short, descriptive summary.
- Reference related issues in the commit message (e.g., `Fix #123`).

## Pull Requests

- Fill out the pull request template, describing your changes and why they are needed.
- Reference any issues that the PR addresses.
- Make sure all checks pass (CI/CD, linting, tests).
